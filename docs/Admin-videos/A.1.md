- The person who creates a project is automatically made the project administrator of that project within Paratext, though this can be changed later.
- A Paratext project administrator can be the team leader, but each project also needs someone who can cope with the extra technical steps required of a Paratext project administrator. 
- A Paratext project can have more than one administrator, so you can have both the team lead and another person who is technically savvy. 
- However, only one person should create and register the project.

These are the steps involved with starting a new Paratext project for a team.
  1. Check for existing Paratext project.
  2. Create a new project in Paratext
  3. Register the new project
  4. If needed, register team members, install Paratext.
  5. Add members to the project, do Send/Receive. 
  6. Create books, import existing translation text. 

:::tip
All but the first task would be best completed by the most technically savvy person available, not necessarily the team lead.
