## DRAFT for proof-reading

The following tasks require an Administrator role. Links to the participant's manual are included if relevant.


## 1 **IS - Install**

**Introduction**  
In this module, you will install Paratext 9. Paratext is the world‚Äôs leading software application for the development and checking of new Bible translation texts, or revisions to existing texts. Developed jointly by UBS and SIL International, it enables consistent and accurate translation, based on original texts, and modelled on versions in major languages. Due in part to its cutting edge collaboration features, Paratext greatly assists in producing higher quality translations in much less time than previous tools and methods have allowed.

**Before you Start**  
You need to uninstall any Paratext 9 Beta version before installing.

**Why is this Important**  
Paratext 7, Paratext 8 and Paratext 9 can all be installed at the same time but you need to understand the limitation of using them together.

1. Several versions may be installed
1. Some use different data directories.
1. My Paratext Projects (Paratext 7)
1. My Paratext 8 Projects (Paratext 9 and 8)
1. My Paratext 9 Projects (Paratext 9)
1. Paratext 7 used a different server (which is now shutdown). Paratext 8 and 9 use the same data servers.

**What are you going to do?**  
You will install Paratext 9 (without uninstalling Paratext 7 or 8). You will also install an update from an MSP file.

----

## 2. **MD - Migrate Data**

**Introduction**  
Migration is the process of moving a project (including all settings files) from **Paratext 7** to Paratext 8 (and then opened in Paratext 9). Paratext 8 projects can be read in Paratext 9 without migration. since Paratext 9 does not have a migration feature, any remaining Paratext 7 projects will need to be migrated to Paratext 8 first.  

**Before you Start**  
The Paratext 7 project must be in the "My Paratext Projects" folder.  You also need to have installed **Paratext 8.**

**Why is this Important?**  
The Paratext 7 server was closed down several years ago, so no Paratext 7 project is being backed-up on the server. Also in order to get the full functionality of Paratext 9 your data needs to be migrated. Since Paratext 7 and Paratext 9 use different send/receive servers all members or the project team must be using Paratext 8 or 9.

Users can have all versions of Paratext 7, 8 and 9 installed on their computers at the same time, but just run one at a time. No project can be shared simultaneously with users in Paratext 7 and users in a different version of Paratext.

Once you have migrated the project, everyone on the team needs to receive the migrated project, and only do work in Paratext 8 or 9 from then on.

You need to have a good Internet connection to migrate the project, but after that, if you usually work without an Internet connection, you can keep working that way in Paratext 9 once the project is migrated.

**What are you going to do?**

You will

- ensure you have the master copy of the Paratext 7 project
- open the project in Paratext  8
- register the project
- migrating the data

:::tip
üí° There are alternative notes on [https://paratext.org/paratext-help-and-support/migration/](https://paratext.org/paratext-help-and-support/migration/)
:::

### 2.2.1 Prepare a project for migration

:::info
 All your users have to upgrade at the same time.
:::

1. In Paratext 8, go to File  Open Project/Resource.
      - *Make sure the box at lower left ‚ÄúShow Paratext 7 projects‚Äù is checked.*
    ![https://paratext.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/image01.png](https://paratext.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/image01.png)
  
2. Select your project.
   - **v7**¬†means Paratext 8 sees it in the Paratext 7 projects folder.
    - **Unregistered**¬†means it isn‚Äôt registered for Paratext 8.
3. Click **OK**.
   - *Paratext will open the migration dialogue box*.  
        ![https://paratext.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/image05.png](https://paratext.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/image05.png)

### Step 1. Register project

There are two main steps to migration, each covered in detail below: 
- **Project Registration** and 
- **Data Migration**

| **Description:**¬†| add more information here if you wish to. There are also fields for more information about the project in the second part of the form.
| **Language:**¬†| The language name has to match an entry in the Ethnologue database. See more detals below.|
:::

**Language**

1. Click the ‚Äú**Advanced**‚Äù box to fill in more information if you need to distinguish the language of your project from the language with that Ethnologue code.  

- *The advanced form looks like this, where choices you select under Script, Region or Variant add extra letters and numbers to the identifier*.
:::info Form and explanation
![https://paratext.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/image04.png](https://paratext.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/image04.png)

 |  |  |
 |--|--|
 |**Scope**¬†| refers to which books you intend to translate, for example, the whole Bible, New Testament, Whole Bible plus Deuterocanon, Portions, etc.|
|**Translation Type:**¬†| -  choose **First** if this is the first translation in this language,|
||-  choose **Revision** if it is a revision of a previous translation, you have to specify that you have permission from the rights holders of the translation you are revising  |
||-  choose **New** if it is a new translation but a previous translation does exist for the language.|  
||-  choose **Study/Help materials** for translations including study materials, such as a Study Bible.|

:::

:::tip
üí° If the eventual rights holder is an organization yet to be formed or recognized, choose something¬†from the list and edit the registration later.
:::

:::info Registration form part 2
**More information**
The second section of the registration form contains several places you can add supplementary information about your project. None of these fields are required.

![https://paratext.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/project-registration-more-information.png](https://paratext.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/project-registration-more-information.png)
:::

:::info Registration form part 3
**Visibility**

![https://paratext.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/project-registration-visibility-options.png](https://paratext.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/project-registration-visibility-options.png)

1. **Standard**¬†is the default choice. Information about the project is not available to the public, but only to registered Paratext users within the same organization.

2. **Test or Training**¬†is good for testing projects or projects you only create to use in a training program or workshop.
3. **Confidential**¬†is for situations where entering information about your project online is a security concern. Information is restricted to members of the project and to those who manage the registration data for the organization.

**Consent**

The last requirement for registration is to indicate that you will comply with the **Forum of Bible Agencies International translation guidelines** (a link is provided) and that you **agree** to keep a backup copy of your project in the Digital Bible library. The Digital Bible library will not share your project with anyone without your express permission.

![https://paratext.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/project-registration-agree-to-FOBAI-and-submit-registration.png](https://paratext.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/project-registration-agree-to-FOBAI-and-submit-registration.png)

:::
:::info
 The Digital Bible Library is a tool for making translations available online or for mobile users, but your project will not be available to anyone until you agree to make it available.
:::

When finished filling out the registration information,

1. Click¬†**Submit Registration**.
    - *If the information is complete, the site should tell you that the registration was accepted. (You may need to scroll to the top of the page to see this)*.
    ![media/image3.png](media/image3.png)

    :::note
    **Update or change registration**

    If later you wish to update or change your project registration, in Paratext you can

     1. Go to **‚â°  Tab**, under project, **Project Settings**, **Project Properties**
     2. Click the¬†**Manage registration**¬†link at the bottom of the **General tab**.
     - OR
     3. Go in your web browser to **registry.paratext.org**,
     4. Find your project and click ‚Äú**Edit**‚Äù.:::  

2. Go back to Paratext.
    - *It should detect that the project is now registered, and inform you that is was sucessful*.
        ![media/image4.png](media/image4.png)

### Step 2 **Migrating a registered project**

1. The migration step has several boxes you have to check off to verify that you understand what is involved.
1. Put a **check** in these boxes if they are true  
    - are all the boxes ticked?
      - yes, click **Migrate Now** to **affirm the above information is correct and request this application be reviewed**
        - When you click **Migrate now**, *Paratext will copy the project from your Paratext 7 into your Paratext 8 folder and will also do a send/receive to the Internet*.
      - no, then click **Migrate Later**
        - finish preparations then come back and click **Migrate Now**.

### Send/receive warning?

:::caution
üí° Paratext 8 is able to check if the Paratext 7 project on your computer has new changes since the last send/receive. If it detects this, it gives you a warning.  
![https://paratext.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/image09.png](https://paratext.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/image09.png)
:::

If you get the warning

1. Click **OK**
    - *this stops the migration process*,
1. Mark a point in the Project History in **Paratext 7**
    - **Project  Mark a point in the Project History,**
    type a comment, **OK**
1. Then **Restart the migration** in Paratext **8**.
    - Open the project in Paratext 8
    - Check the boxes
    - Click Migrate now.
        - *A message should be displayed to say the migration should be successful*.
1. Now your colleagues can go to **Paratext 9** and do a **Send/Receive** to receive the migrated project.

### 2.3 Additional Project settings

1. **Language identifier**: After you click ‚ÄúMigrate now‚Äù, Paratext 9 may tell you that need to specify a language identifier for your project.

  - You can verify what the language name and language identifier are for your project by going to
    - ‚â° Tab, under Project  Project Properties  Language settings.
    - *The language identifier is either in brackets after the language name, or listed separately below the  name*.

1. **Books** The project properties and settings has a **Books** tab, you specify here the books that you plan to track their progress in your project.

- You can choose book by book, or specify **Old Testament**, **New Testament**, **Deuterocanon** by using the buttons. You can change this list of books later on in the project if your plans for the project change.
:::info
 **Note**: Once you have migrated your project, you also need to migrate the back translation and any other daughter projects (one after the other).
:::
:::danger
Remember, **do not edit** the project in Paratext 7. That would be wasted effort as no one else will see their changes.
:::

To help your team members remember this, you could have them **remove the project from their Paratext 7** once they have it in Paratext 9. Or maybe they can uninstall Paratext 7 from their computer if they don't need it for other projects.

----

## 3. **REG - Registration**

**Introduction**  
Starting with **Paratext 8** it is a requirement that projects share their basic metadata information with the translation community. It is strongly encouraged that they share progress information [some organizations and/or donors may require this].

**Before you Start**  
Paratext 9 has been installed on your computer and you have the Paratext 7 registration codes for your team members.

**Why is this Important?**  
In Paratext 9 both users and projects should to be registered. Access to specific text resources, e.g. TEV, is determined by what organization you are a part of.

Projects may be registered by the administrator (or a consultant serving as an administrator)

Other organizations/users are notified and may object to BoG. Basic project metadata information is available to all in Paratext community.

If your project is not registered you will not have access to

- Interlinearizer
- Internet Send/Receive
- statistical glossing tools (guess translation)
- Print Draft

**What are you going to do?**

- You will register a P9 user
- You will register a new P9 project
- You will see what information is displayed in the ParaTExt Registry for a registered project.

## 4. **CP - Creating a new project**

**4.1 Introduction**

In this module, you will create and register a new project.

**Before you can start**

You need to have already installed Paratext and registered a user.

**Why is this Important**

A new aspect in Paratext 9 is that projects need to be registered as well as users. This may feel like an extra complication, but it does offer benefits to users.

As we saw in the user registration section, the project administrator can create registrations for users they want to be part of their project.

**What are you going to do?**

We will create and register a new project.

### 4.2 Create a new project

1. **File**  **New Project**
    - *The New project dialog is displayed.*

    ![media/image14.png](media/image14.png)

### 4.3 Name for the project

1. Click the **Edit** button
    - **The ‚Äúedit name‚Äù dialog is displayed**

    ![media/image16.png](media/image16.png)

1. In the name section, under Full name, type a name which includes the name of the language.
1. Under short name enter the **ISO** code for the language.

:::tip
 The ISO code is the preferred short name for the DBL.
:::

:::info
Once you create a project name, **the short name cannot be changed,** because this is the name Paratext will give to the folder containing the project files, and also the name given to the project on the Internet server. (**If you  need to change the name, you can convert the project to a new project with a different short name.** But it can take many hours to convert a project.)
:::

### 4.4 Specify language

1. If you have another Paratext project in the same language, you can just pick the language from the list in Paratext **[2]**. If not, you will need to create a new language.
2. Click on **New**
    - *The Choose language identifier box is displayed .*

![media/image18.png](media/image18.png)

1. Click in the **Search** box
1. Start typing the name of your language
    - *Paratext will display matching names.*
1. Click on your language in the list.
    - *Paratext will add the language name.*
1. Fill in the advanced fields if necessary.
1. Click **OK**.

:::info
 You can also specify additional information if needed in the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù section of the language settings dialog.
:::

### 4.5 Type of project

1. Click the drop-down list beside ‚Äú**Type of Project**‚Äù
1. Choose the appropriate type for your project.
    - *If it is a back translation, or a daughter or transliteration project, you will need to define the source or base text.*

### 4.6 Register the new project

1. Make sure you have given the project a name and chosen the project type.
1. Click **Register online** to go to the registration page
1. Fill in the information (see above)
1. Click **Register** to submit and return to Paratext.
    - *Paratext should "automagically" detect that the project is now registered,*
1. Click **OK** to create the new project.

The types of projects that do not need to be registered separately:

1. Projects that inherit their inscription from the parent project.

- Back translations
- Transliterations
- Auxiliary
- Consultant notes.

### 4.7 Editing your registration

As you work in your project, you can change your registration information later on.

1. From Paratext, make sure you are connected to the Internet,
1. **‚â° Tab**, under  **Project**  **Project Settings**  **Properties**
1. Click the ‚Äú**Manage registration**‚Äù link.
    - *This will bring up the project registration info and you can edit it. Any project administrator can edit the registration info.*

## 6. **PP1 - Setup Project Plan**

**Introduction**

‚ÄúProgress tracking‚Äù based on a Project Plan and Assignments and Progress is an improved feature in **Paratext** 9.1 that impacts the day-to-day work of translation teams.

**Before you Start**

Before you can add the plan the project must have been created/or migrated.

**Why is this Important**

There are many tasks to be done in a translation project. It is important to have a system to ensure that all of these are done. It is also good to have an easy way to generate reports for supervisors and funders (see PP2: Project Plan Report).

Setting up a project plan from scratch is daunting. Various Bible translation organizations (UBS/ABU, SIL and The Seed Company) include "basic" plans that can be applied to projects. Teams need only customize these plans within the limits set by their organizations.

Typically, organizations want conformity at the ‚ÄúStage‚Äù level in order to facilitate meaningful tracking of the progress of project across the entire organization. However, every plan will need to be customized at the task level.

If a task is important to you and your team and you want to track its progress, then it can be included in the project plan (even if it doesn't require Paratext to do the task).

**What are you going to do?**

You will use a combination of two features: the settings of the **Project Plan** and the **Assignments and Progress** (sometimes referred to as ‚Äúprogress tracking‚Äù) to manage the plan by assigning team members to tasks, and tracking their progress in completing those tasks.

- Add the organizational base plan to the project (remove an old plan if necessary)
- Customize the plan for the team by adding/deleting and moving tasks
- Assign the tasks to the various team members.
- Update the base plan whenever there is a new version.

1. Is the item valid all the time? Or just in certain situations?

**Scripture Reference Settings**

1. What book names are you using?
1. What is the format for a reference?
1. Where will you put the origin of notes?

----

## 8. **CV - Convert project**

**Introduction**

If you have ever needed to rename your project, reduce the size of your project, change user names, change the encoding or struggled with composed/decomposed diacritics, then the convert project tool will help you solve these problems.

**Before you Start**

You must be the administrator of the project to do these conversions.

**Why is this Important**

Although, it is possible to make some changes to existing projects through the project and setting dialogs, several major changes require that a new project is created. Using the convert project dialog allows the new project to keep the project history.

**What are you going to do?**

We will work through the six changes that can be made to your project.

1. Changing the short name of the project
1. Removing deleted files from the project history
1. Clean up Paratext Live history
1. Convert encoding to 65001 ‚Äì Unicode (UTF8)
1. Normalising ‚Äì composed or decomposed
1. Replacing old User names

### 8.2 The convert project dialog

1. From the  **‚â° Project**, under **Project**, choose **Advanced**, then **Convert Project**

**8.2.1 Changing the short name of the project**

1. Confirm that the old name of the project is correct. (If not, close the dialogue and click in the correct project window, and access the dialog again.)
1. Enter the new short name for the project in **[1]**.

**8.2.2 Removing deleted files from the project history**

1. **[2]** Select this if you have deleted files (such as large illustration files) that you no longer want to be part of project history and no longer want in the project repository.

**8.2.3 Clean up Paratext Live history**

1. **[3]** Select this if you have edited the project with Paratext Live and want to replace names in the project history.

**8.2.4 Convert encoding to 65001 ‚Äì Unicode (UTF8)**

1. **[4]** Select this to convert a standard project encoding to Unicode.

**8.2.5 Normalising ‚Äì composed or decomposed**

1. **[5]** Select Composed (NFC) or one of the options in the drop-down list if the data in your project was created using a mix of composed and decomposed characters. (See the Guide for more details).

**8.2.6 Replacing old User names**

1. **[6]** Select the name of the user you want to replace from the drop-down list.
1. **[7]** Enter the name of a registered Paratext user in this box.
1. **[8]** Click **Add**,
    - *a summary of the replacement appears, with a "Remove" button.*

    ![media/image35.png](media/image35.png)

1. (Click Remove if you either made a mistake in typing the name in the "With" field OR decide not to make the replacement.)

### 8.3 Convert the project

1. **[9]** Click **OK** to convert the project.

## 9. **CR - Cross-references**

**Introduction**

Most languages do not have access to concordances or other Bible study materials in their own languages. Adding cross references to your New Testament can greatly help your reader understand the text by helping your reader find passages on similar themes. There are several list availalbe (with thousands of cross-references). Some lists can be exported from a model text and then inserted at once.

**Before you Start**

Before you can insert cross references from a model text your administrator must have created all the books (and chapters and verses) in your project. They can be empty but they must be present.

**Why is this Important**

Reading the New Testament is not like reading a novel. Having access to cross references allows your reader to find similar passages. Nevertheless, adding cross references one by one is too tedious. The **Insert cross reference** feature allows you to insert all of the cross references at once and also converts the book names and punctuation to match your **Scripture reference settings**. Extracting cross-references from a model text allows you to easily insert the same cross-references.

**What are you going to do?**

We are going to do three things:

1. export the cross reference from a model text;
1. make sure all the settings for book names and scripture references have been entered for your project;
1. finally insert the cross references.

If you don't have a model text with the desired cross-reference, you can create your own list and import it.

### 9.2 Extract the references from the model text

1. Open the model text.
2. **‚â° Project** under **Advanced**, choose **Extract cross references**
3. Type a file name
4. Click **OK**.
:::tip
üí° Note: Some Resource texts may not allow you to extract cross references.
:::

### 9.3 Check your scripture reference settings

1. **‚â° Tab** under **Project**, select **Project Properties**  **Scripture Reference Settings**.
2. Verify that the following have been correctly defined for your project (edit them if necessary).
    - The punctuation on the **Reference Format** tab.
    - The book abbreviations on the **Book Names** tab.
3. Click **OK**.

### 9.4 Check your Language Settings

1. **‚â° Tab** under **Project**, select **Project Properties**  **Language Settings** ‚Ä¶
2. Click the **Other Characters** tab.
3. In the **Verse segment characters** box, enter at least six different characters separated by spaces.
4. Click **OK**.

### 9.5 Insert Cross references

1. **‚â° Tab** under **Project** menu, point to **Advanced**, and then select **Insert Cross References**.
1. Click **Browse**...
1. Find the .xrf file of extracted cross references.
1. Select the file, and click **Open**.
1. If desired, select one or more of the options:
    - (see the guide for more info)
1. Click **OK**
:::info
 If the Copyright box displays a copyright notice or required statement of acknowledgments, copy the text, and then paste it wherever you keep this kind of information for the project.
