title: 3. REGU - User Registration
sidebar_position: 6
---
**Introduction**  
All users need to be registered to use Paratext. Paratext 8 users can use their existing registration in Paratext 9. New users and any users that haven't upgraded their Paratext 7 registration will need to register for Paratext 9.


**Before you start**  
Paratext 9 has been installed on your computer and you have the Paratext 7 registration codes for your team members (if applicable). It is preferable that all users have their own email address. If not, the administrator can register them.

**Why is this Important?**  
In Paratext 9 both users and projects should be registered. Access to specific text resources, e.g. TEV, is determined by what organization you are a part of.

**What are you going to do?**
- You will register a Paratext 9 user
  - with a google email address
  - with a non-google email address
  - without an email address
- Generate a new code for a user.



## 3.1 Register (with a Google account)

1. Go to [https://registry.paratext.org](https://registry.paratext.org/) in your web browser.
    - *The “Sign in” screen is displayed*.
1. Enter your email account.
    - *The site will check if your account exists, and if it is on a Google server, you will have the choice of authenticating with Google*.

:::info
 Anyone can register to use Paratext, but people who are not members of a translation organization and who are not members of a registered project will not be able to use all the features of Paratext and will have access to only a few resources.

   - *The server will give you a code. It will also send this to your email*.
:::info
 Keep that email, or the code that is displayed here, because if you lose it, there is no way to look it up again. (This is a security feature, user codes are not stored on the server so they cannot be stolen if someone hacks onto the server). However new codes can be generated see section [3.5.5] below.

## 3.3 Register for Paratext with a non-google account

1. If your email account is not on a Google server, or if it is but you choose to not use Google to authenticate, the registry server will ask you to enter a password.

:::caution
It is unclear how many text resource owners will grant access to this group.
