title: 5. MD - Migrate Paratext 7 Project
sidebar_position: 8
---

:::caution 
Migration is only necessary for Paratext 7 projects.
:::

**Introduction**  
Migration is the process of moving a project (including all settings files) from **Paratext 7** to Paratext 8 (and then opened in Paratext 9). Paratext 8 projects can be read in Paratext 9 without migration. Since Paratext 9 does not have a migration feature, any remaining Paratext 7 projects will need to be **migrated to Paratext 8 first**.  

**Before you start**  
The Paratext 7 project must be in the "My Paratext Projects" folder.  You also need to have installed **Paratext 8.**   The administrator must have all the data (that is, the authoritative copy of the project). If needed, make sure all team members have done a send/receive (by USB stick). Repeat the process twice to ensure all the team's data has been incorporated. 

**Why is this Important?**  
The Paratext 7 server was closed down several years ago, so no Paratext 7 project is being backed up on the server. Also in order to get the full functionality of Paratext 9 your data needs to be migrated. As Paratext 7 and Paratext 9 use different send/receive servers, all members or the project team must be using Paratext 8 or 9.

Users can have all versions of Paratext 7, 8 and 9 installed on their computers at the same time, but just run one at a time. No project can be shared simultaneously with users in Paratext 7 and users in a different version of Paratext.

Once you have migrated the project, everyone on the team needs to receive the migrated project, and only do work in Paratext 8 or 9 from then on.

You need to have a good Internet connection to migrate the project, but after that, if you usually work without an Internet connection, you can keep working that way in Paratext 9 once the project is migrated.

**What are you going to do?**

You will

- ensure you have the master copy of the Paratext 7 project
- open the project in Paratext 8
- register the project
- migrate the data

## 5.1 Prepare a project Paratext 7 for migration

2. Select your project.
   - **v7** means Paratext 8 sees it in the Paratext 7 projects folder.
    - **Unregistered** means it isn’t registered for Paratext 8.
3. Click **OK**.
   - *Paratext will open the migration dialogue box*.

## 5.3 Complete migration

1. The migration step has several boxes you have to check off to verify that you understand what is involved.
1. Put a **check** in these boxes if they are true  
    - are all the boxes ticked?
      - yes, click **Migrate Now** to **affirm the above information is correct and request this application be reviewed**
         - When you click **Migrate now**, *Paratext will copy the project from your Paratext 7 into your Paratext 8 folder and will also do a send/receive to the Internet*.
      - no, then click **Migrate Later**
         - finish preparations then come back and click **Migrate Now**.

### Send/receive warning?

:::caution
Paratext 8 is able to check if the Paratext 7 project on your computer has new changes since the last send/receive. If it detects this, it gives you a warning.

:::

If you get the warning

1. Click **OK**
    - *this stops the migration process*,
1. In **Paratext 7**, you need to mark a point in the Project History  
1. From the **Project  menu**, choose **Mark a point in the Project History,**
1. Type a comment, click **OK**

**Restart the migration**
1. Go to Paratext **8**.
1. Open the project in Paratext 8
1. Check the boxes
1. Click **Migrate now**.
     - *A message should be displayed to say the migration was successful*.
1. Now your colleagues can go to **Paratext 9** and do a **Send/Receive** to receive the migrated project.

### Additional Project settings

1. **Language identifier**: After you click “Migrate now”, Paratext 9 may tell you that need to specify a language identifier for your project.

  - You can verify what the language name and language identifier are for your project by going to
    - ≡ Tab, under Project  Project Properties  Language settings.
    - *The language identifier is either in brackets after the language name, or listed separately below the  name*.

1. **Books** The project properties and settings has a **Books** tab, you specify here the books that you plan to track their progress in your project.

- You can choose book by book, or specify **Old Testament**, **New Testament**, **Deuterocanon** by using the buttons. You can change this list of books later on in the project if your plans for the project change.
:::info
 **Note**: Once you have migrated your project, you also need to migrate the back translation and any other daughter projects (one after the other).
:::

:::danger Warning
Remember, **do not edit** the project in Paratext 7. That would be wasted effort as no one else will see their changes.
:::

To help your team members remember this, you could have them **remove the project from their Paratext 7** once they have it in Paratext 9. Or maybe they can uninstall Paratext 7 from their computer if they don't need it for other projects.
