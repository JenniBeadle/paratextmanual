**Introduction**  
In this module, you will install Paratext 9. Paratext is the world’s leading software application for the development and checking of new Bible translation texts, or revisions to existing texts. Developed jointly by UBS and SIL International, it enables consistent and accurate translation, based on original texts, and modelled on versions in major languages. Due in part to its cutting edge collaboration features, Paratext greatly assists in producing higher quality translations in much less time than previous tools and methods have allowed.

**Before you start**  
You do not need to uninstall older versions of Paratext, but you do need to uninstall any Paratext 9 Beta version before installing the release version. 

:::tip
Before uninstalling the BETA version, you should save any window layouts that you want to use in Paratext 9.3. 
:::

**Why is this Important**  
Paratext 7, Paratext 8 and Paratext 9 can all be installed at the same time but you need to understand the limitation of using them together.

- Several versions may be installed
- Some use different data directories.
  - My Paratext Projects (Paratext 7)
  - My Paratext 8 Projects (Paratext 9 and 8)
  - My Paratext 9 Projects (Paratext 9)
- Paratext 8 and 9 use the same data servers.
- Paratext 7 used a different server (which is now shutdown). 

**What are you going to do?**  
You will install Paratext 9 (without uninstalling Paratext 7 or 8). You will also install updates from the Help menu.
