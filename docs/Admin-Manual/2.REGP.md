**Introduction**  
Starting with **Paratext 8** it is a requirement that projects share their basic metadata information with the translation community. It is strongly encouraged that they share progress information [some organizations and/or donors may require this].

Projects may be registered by the administrator (or a consultant serving as an administrator)

**Before you start**  
Paratext 9 has been installed on your computer, and you have created a project. If not, to create a project see, [4. CP](4.CP.md) to create a project.

**Why is this Important?**  
Other organizations/users are notified and may object to BoG. Basic project metadata information is available to all in Paratext community.

If your project is not registered, you will not have access to

- Interlinearizer
- Internet Send/Receive
- statistical glossing tools (guess translation)
- Print Draft
