**Introduction**

*Note: This is equivalent to the third stage of the UBS plan.*

The fifth stage of a translation project is the review by the community. In the review you will check for naturalness, produce a team progress report and revise the key terms.

The following modules will help you in this stage:

-   [**PPR: Progress report**](#sPPR)
-   [**BTR: Biblical key terms report**](#sBTR)
