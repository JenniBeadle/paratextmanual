title: 2. OD – Organising your desktop 
---

**Introduction**  
As you work with your text in Paratext 9 you will want to see a variety of resources. In this module, you will learn how to open resources and organise your desktop.

**Where we are**  
We are getting ready to type text into an existing project. Before you can do this, someone must have already installed the program, created a project for your data and installed resources for you.

**Why this is important**  
The translator who organises his/her desktop well has all the resources necessary for his/her work.

**What are you going to do?**  
You will start the Paratext 9 program and open a previously saved layout (text combination). If needed you will open other resources, change the arrangement of the windows and resave the text layout.

**Changes in Paratext 9**  
The menus changed in Paratext 9.0. To see the menu, you now need to click on the menu icon ≡. There are now two types of menus. The main Paratext menu is on the title bar (![](../media/a7c437f2736cb28b0dff7abd780f5f94.png)) and each window (or tab) has its own menu (![](../media/65ab77824a1e025fac1bf88feb6ba66f.png)). When you click on one of these menu icons all the menus are displayed and you just need to click on the command.

:::tip
In this manual, when it says **≡ Paratext**, under **Menu** \> **Command** (e.g. **≡ Paratext**, under **Paratext** \> **Open**). It means click on the Paratext menu icon ≡, then under the menu (e.g. Paratext) choose the command (e.g. Open). 

And when it says **≡ Tab**, under **Menu** \> **Command** it means click on the tab menu icon, then under the menu (e.g. Tools) click on the command (e.g. Wordlist). It also says **menu** project**
