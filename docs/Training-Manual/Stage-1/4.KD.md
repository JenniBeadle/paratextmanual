title: KD – Keyboarding your draft
---
**Introduction**  
This module explains how to keyboard your draft translations into a project in Paratext 9.

**Where we are**  
We are about to keyboard text into an existing project. Before you can do that, someone must have already installed the program and created a project for your data.

**Why this is important**  
This is the first stage of entering your translation into the computer. Once the text has been typed, you can run various checks on the content and format of the text.

## 4.1 Go to a Biblical verse

:::tip
Before you can start typing your text, you need to move your cursor to the right book, chapter and verse. You use the toolbar to do this.
:::

-   Using the icons on the toolbar, change the project, book, chapter and verse as needed.

:::tip
If you don't know the verse reference, you could use the **Find** feature to look for a word. Ctrl+F.
:::

## 4.2 Check that the project is editable

-   Look at the titlebar of your project.  
    ![](../media/2aebd544c3f685df0315dd065853516f.png)  
    *The titlebar should have the word (Editable).*  
-   If the book is not editable, and you need to edit it, you should talk with your project administrator.
-   If it is not editable, try changing the view (see below).

## 4.3 Changing the view

:::tip
Paratext 9 has five views. All but the Preview view are editable.
:::

-   **Ctrl** + **E** -or-
-   **≡ Tab** under **View** menu, choose the view (usually Standard).

## 4.4 Typing special characters

:::tip
Some orthographic characters are not found on the keyboard. To type these characters, you need to press more than one key.
:::

-   Change your keyboard system as needed on your computer.
-   If you are using Keyman then choose your keyboard (e.g. Tchad Unicode

    (or for MS-Keyboards choose AF or TR/SQ/TZ/AF…)

-   Type the keys as in the table in Appendix <#sChadSpecChar>.

:::tip
Note: You can use **≡ Tab** under **View** \> **Highlight Invalid Characters** to quickly see if you have typed any invalid characters.
:::

## 4.5 Adding text in another marker – title or introduction

:::tip
Each piece of text needs to have a marker. The markers for the chapters and verses are already in your project. When you want to add text such as headings, or introductions etc you need to also add the appropriate marker as follows:
:::

-   Move your cursor to the end of the previous paragraph:
-   Type **Enter** or type « \\ »
-   Type the marker (e.g. s1 or ip) « **Enter** » (or select it from the list).
-   Type the text
-   Add a paragraph marker after the   
    (for example: \\p)

:::tip
You must always have a USFM marker after a title and before the verse. This is usually \\p (paragraph), but it can be different (for example \\q1).
:::

## 4.6 Add paragraph breaks

:::tip
Dividing the text into paragraphs:
:::

-   Move the cursor to where you want to break the paragraph.
-   Press **Enter**
-   Type p, then **Enter**.

## 4.7 Saving your work

:::tip
It is important to save your work regularly.
:::

-   **≡ Paratext** under **Paratext** \> **Save All**
-   –or- **Ctrl** + **S**

## 4.8 Insert Footnotes

:::tip
You can add footnotes in the text at the place where you want the reference to appear.
:::

-   Move the cursor to where you want to insert the footnote.  
-   **≡ Tab**, under **Insert** \> **Footnote**  
    *A set of footnote markers is added in the box below the text*  
    ![](../media/2b33a4d17a03ff35921422daecbb4331.png)

-   Type the text after the \\ft

:::tip
If you hover your mouse over the superscript letter the text of the footnote will be displayed in a tip box.

To **change** the footnote, **click** the superscript letter in the text.

To **delete** the footnote, you can **delete** the superscript letter.
:::

## 4.9 Send/receive

:::tip
It is essential to have a second copy of your translation and to share your work with others in your team. This is done by doing a send/receive as follows:
:::

### Send/receive this project to the Internet

-   Make sure your computer is connected to the Internet.
-   **≡ Tab** under **Project**,\> **Send/Receive this project**
-   *Paratext will immediately send/Receive i.e. without offering the different options.*

### Send/receive to the Internet

-   Make sure your computer is connected to the Internet.
-   If you want to send/receive other projects, or change the way to send/receive
-   **≡ Paratext** under **Paratext**,\> **Send/Receive projects**
-   Choose **Internet Server**
-   Check the box next to the projects to Send/Receive.
-   Click **Send/Receive**.   
    *The computer will make a copy of your files. A progress meter will be displayed. A message box will only appear if there are any problems.*

### Send/receive to a USB stick to backup your data

It is essential to have a second copy of your translation. If you don't have access to the Internet, then you can use a USB stick. To backup your data to a USB stick you do a send/receive as follows:

-   Insert your USB key into your computer.
-   **≡ Paratext**, under **Paratext** \> **Send/Receive project(s**)

    ![](../media/f0ebd42df124bfaa7ae66d287fa5e960.png)

-   Choose **USB drive**.
-   Check the box next to the projects to Send/Receive.
-   Click **Send/Receive**.  
    *The computer will make a copy of your files. A progress meter will be displayed. A message box will only appear if there are any problems.*

### Send/Receive Again

:::tip
The next time you want to send/receive you can use the toolbar to send/receive using the same settings as the previous time. This option does not allow you to choose a different method or different projects.
:::

-   Insert your USB stick into your computer or connect to the Internet.
-   Click the Send/Receive icon ![](../media/1ef2ba0646b2eb0477c00f3ef38057f4.png)  
    *Paratext will immediately send/Receive.*

## 4.10 Moving your cursor efficiently

A lot of time is spent moving your cursor to the place where you need to add text or make corrections. Here are some useful keystrokes to move your cursor quickly.

-   The arrow keys, **←** **↑** **→** **↓**

    **Home**, **End**, **PgUp**, et **PgDn**,

    **F8** (chapter), **F9** (book)

-   or **Ctrl** + any of those keys
