# Paratext Documentation

This documentation website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

It contains the Paratext manual in English and French and versions 9.2 and the next 9.3.
along with summaries of most of the 95 videos (in English and French).

# To do
The content has been converted. A final naturalness check of the French is needed.

## PDF files for printing
Each year the Paratext Manual increases in size. This year is no exception. The combined (Manual and Video Summaries) are over 466 pages.
PDF files are being prepared, but with separate Manual and Video summaries. But I am waiting on an upgrade to docu-pdf to allow a large number of exclusions.
