# Paratext Documentation

This documentation website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

It contains the Paratext manual in English and French and versions 9.2, 9.3 and the next.
along with summaries of most of the 95 videos (in English and French).

# To do
The content has been converted and updated. A final naturalness check of the French would be appreciated. 

Perfection is not possible but continual improvements are being made.

# PDF files for printing
Each year the Paratext Manual increases in size. This year is no exception. The combined (Manual and Video Summaries) are over 466 pages (for each version of each language).

PDF files have been produced, but with separate files for the Manual and Video summaries. 

HTML files do not have a concept of pages and therefore the page breaks do not fall at convenient places. I have had numerous attempts at adding gaps to force page breaks but have not always been successful.
