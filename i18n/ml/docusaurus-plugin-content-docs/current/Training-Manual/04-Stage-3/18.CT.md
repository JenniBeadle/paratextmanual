title: 18. CT – Compare Text
---
**Introduction**  
In this module, you will learn how to save your text at various points and review them later.

**Before you start**  
You have worked on your text and you have arrived at an important stage of your project.

**Why is this important?**  
As you work on your translation, you will be continually making changes. It is good to have a copy of your text as it was at a particular point, for example as it was before you went to a consultant check. 

**What will you do?**  
You will mark a point in the history of the project. Later you can compare the text at different points.

## 18.1 Mark Point in History
1.  Click in your project window to make it active (in Paratext).
1.  **≡ Tab** under **Project** \> **Mark a point in project history**
1.  Type a comment to describe the point.
2.  Click **OK** 
      -  *The point is added to the project history list*.
  
:::tip
It is good to start the comment with some symbols, like **\#\#**, to easily identify the points you have added in the long list of automatic points that Paratext creates.
