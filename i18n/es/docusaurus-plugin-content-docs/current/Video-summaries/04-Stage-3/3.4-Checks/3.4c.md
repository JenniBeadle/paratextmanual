title: Quoted Text (3.4c)
---
The Quoted Text check has nothing to do with quotes in the text marked with quotation marks.

Rather, this check verifies that any text marked as quoted in a footnote (\\fq) or cross-reference (\\fx) or keyword (\\fk) matches the text in the verse.

### Adding \\fq, \\fx

1.  Select text (in the verse)
1.  Insert a footnote (Ctrl+Shift+N)  
    -  *The text is copied into the footnote with the quoted text markers*.

A **discrepancy** will arise if the verse text is edited **after** the text is quoted in the footnote, and no one remembers to **update** the footnote.

### Run check from Assignments and Progress dialog

To view a list of the Quoted Text issues
1.  Open the Assignments and Progress dialogue (blue button),

    -  *Paratext opens a panel showing the issues*.
1.  To view the mismatching text in the project window, double-click the item in the list.  
    -  *Paratext selects the quoted text that needs updating*.

You need to look at the verse text to figure out what is different.

1.  Click **OK**.  
    -  *The list now displays errors from all the checks that were selected and in all the books selected*.
