title: Show Changes, Resolve (2.5c)
---
In this video, we will learn how to view what has changed in the verse since the note was created, and how to resolve a note when the to-do item has been taken care of.

**See what has changed since the note was originally inserted.**

-  Click the multi-coloured button which includes the strikethrough and underline.
    -  *This button turns a special comparison pane on and off*.

**Change display style**

-  Click the button next to the Show Changes button, to change the view

There are three possible views,

1. The first view (the default)   
    - **added text** is shown with a **green** background and 
    -   **deleted text** is shown with a **red** background.
2. The second view  
   -  **added** text with **underlines** and 
   -  **deleted** text with **strikethrough**,
3. The third view  
   -  **added** text with **underlines** and 
   -  **deleted** text **superscripted**.

**Resolve notes (mark as complete)**

When a note is completed, you resolve the note.

-  Click the **Resolve** button.
    -  *The note icon is removed from the scripture view, although the note is still stored in the project and can be viewed again if needed*.
