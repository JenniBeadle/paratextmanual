**Introduction**  
As you work with your text in Paratext 9 you will want to see a variety of resources. In this module, you will learn how to open resources and organise your desktop.

**Before you start**  
We are getting ready to type text into an existing project. Before you can do this, someone must have already installed the program, created a project for your data and installed resources for you.

**Why this is important**  
The translator who organises his/her desktop well has all the resources necessary for his/her work.

**What are you going to do?**

You will start the Paratext 9 program and open a previously saved layout (text combination). If needed you will open other resources, change the arrangement of the windows and resave the text combination.

:::info Videos 
There are a number of videos available to help you with the different types of resources and arranging the windows. E.g. 0.2.1b-0.2.1d, 0.2.2a

**Changes in Paratext 9**

The menus have changed in Paratext 9. To see the menu, you now need to click on the menu icon ≡. There are now two types of menus. The main Paratext menu is on the title bar (![](../media/a7c437f2736cb28b0dff7abd780f5f94.png)) and each window (or tab) has its own menu (![](../media/65ab77824a1e025fac1bf88feb6ba66f.png)). When you click on one of these menu icons all the menus are displayed and you just need to click on the command.

:::tip
In the manual, when it says **≡ Paratext**, under **Menu** \> **Command**. It means click on the Paratext menu icon ≡, then under the menu (e.g. File) choose the command (e.g. Open). And when it says **≡ Tab**, under **Menu** \> **Command** it means click on the tab menu icon, then under the menu (e.g. Tools) click on the command (e.g. Wordlist)

If you haven’t already saved a layout, then we recommend you do the following:

## 2.5 Open resources in a Text collection

:::tip
With Paratext, it is possible to have several project/resources open at the same time. However, rather than having too many windows, it is better to have several texts in one window.
:::

1. **≡ Paratext** menu, under **Paratext** \> **Open**

1. Repeat as necessary.
1. Click on the **Open as** dropdown list.
1. Choose **Text collection**
1. Click **OK**

:::tip
N.B. It is suggested that resources be presented in the order of more literal to less literal (to focus on the texts that are most faithful to the source texts). For French resources, the following order is suggested: TOB, NVSR78Col, NBS, BDS, FC97, PDV11. For English resources: ESV, RSV, NIV, NLT.
:::

To change the order of texts in the collection
1. **≡ Tab**, **Modify text collection**
