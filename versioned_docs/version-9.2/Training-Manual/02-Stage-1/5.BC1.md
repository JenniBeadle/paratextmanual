title: 5. BC1 – Basic checks
---
**Introduction**  
In this module, you will check the chapters/verses and the markers using two methods: The Project plan and the project menus (Checking).

**Where we are**  
You have typed your text in Paratext 9. Now you want to start checking. In this module we start with the first two basic checks. The remaining checks are covered in [BC2 – Basic Checks](../03-Stage-2/12.BC2.md) and [BC3 - Basic Checks](../04-Stage-3/19.BC3.md). 

**Why this is important**  
These checks allow you to be sure that you have all the chapters and verses and that the other markers are correct. It is important to run the chapter/verse check first because all the other checks depend on it. Doing these checks allows you to complete the Drafting stage.

**What you are going to do**  
You are going to run the first two basic checks using two different methods. The easiest way is to run the checks from the project plan. However, you can also do the checks from the project menu **(Tools)** if you need to check more than one book at a time.

## 5.1 Running checks from the project plan
It is easier to run the checks from the project plan.

1. View the project plan by clicking on the icon  
    (at the top right of your project window).![](../media/4b0b6eb237606727f105a01beffe64c2.png)
1. If there are any "issues" (errors), click the blue link to the right  
    - *A window appears with a list of the errors.*

1. Correct the error in your project.
1. Double-click the next line in the list.
1. Continue for each error.
2. Click "**Rerun**" button to check that all the errors have been corrected.
3. Close the results list window.
4. Return to the project plan, and click on the link to show the issues from the markers check.
