title: 22. BTR – Biblical key terms report
---
**Introduction**  
One task in this stage is to produce a report of the changes made in the key biblical terms.

**Where we are**  
In working on your translation you have identified and changed a number of key biblical terms.

**Why is this important?**  
Although you can’t use Paratext to write the report, it can produce of list of the terms that you have been dealing with and may need to include in your report.

**What are you going to do?**  
In the Biblical terms tool you will filter on the book(s) that you want to include in your report. You will then save the list of the terms as a separate HTML file. You can also filter the list on any discussion notes you may have made.
