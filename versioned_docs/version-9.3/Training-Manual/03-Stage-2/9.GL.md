title: 9. GL - Glossary
---
**Introduction**  
This module explains how to add entries to the glossary using the **Biblical terms** tool.

**Where we are**  
You have drafted and entered your text in Paratext 9. Now you will add some glossary entries to explain some of the terms.

**Why this is important**  
It is good to have a list of important words and their explanations so that the readers can understand the text well. Rather than typing directly into the glossary, it is better to use the **Biblical terms** tool as it keeps the Glossary in alphabetical order. The tool also keeps track of the changes to the glossary.

**What you are going to do**  
You will use the Biblical terms tool to add a rendering for the term and then use the glossary tab to enter the citation form and the definition.

There are four training videos available on [adding](../../Video-summaries/5a.Glossary/1A.4a.md), [linking](../../Video-summaries/5a.Glossary/1A.4c.md) and [editing](../../Video-summaries/5a.Glossary/1A.4d.md) and getting [permission to edit](../../Video-summaries/5a.Glossary/1A.4b.md) glossaries. (P9 1A.4a-d).

### 9.1 Open the Biblical Terms tool
-  Move to a verse which contains the term you want to add to the glossary.
-  Right-click and choose **View Biblical Terms**, then **Current Verset(s)**
-  Check that you have the correct list open (e.g. your project list or the NT Key Biblical Terms [SIL])

### 9.3 Link an existing entry

If the word is already in the glossary, you can link a biblical term to the existing entry in the glossary. Later in stage 6 you will link the biblical term to the text to add the \* in the printed text or the link in the electronic app.
