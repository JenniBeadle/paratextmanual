-  Add **illustrations** and captions

-  Verify all checks are complete

### 24.1 Choosing illustrations and captions

There are over 2800 images available, so it can be difficult to choose illustrations. Fortunately, it is now possible to search for images by chapter reference and by keywords in French. Note that any illustration you insert into Paratext will increase the size of your project. Only add these small jpg files (or alternatively just the file name). When composing, they will be replaced by larger, high-resolution images.

**Create a folder of images to search**

First time:

- Open the link https://tiny.cc/sampleimages on the Internet
- Right-click on the folder **Illustrations - French**,
- Select **Download**  
    -  *It will download about 121MB*.
- Search and open the downloaded **zip file**.
- Extract the single folder in the archive: **Illustrations - French** and put it in your **Images** folder  
    -  *(Windows starts to index the contents of the images…)*

**Try various searches**

When your images are indexed, you can try different searches.

- Open this new folder in the **File Explorer**.  
    ![](../media/8dca24a8d36d8960c4e0a54ddb5ea755.png)
- Type in the search field:
- **A search word**, like cross, sheep, house, etc.
- A Bible reference**, like MAT27, ACT03, etc. (using at least 2 digits for the chapter).
- Add **black** or **-color** to display only black and white images.

### 24.2 Adding illustrations and captions

- If applicable, type in a verse range as an acceptable location. [\*] [Optional]
- Enter the necessary copyright information about the image [4]
- Paratext will fill in the chapter and verse reference that pertains to the image. [5]

**Browse to find the image file**

- Click **Browse**… to search for the image file. [7]  
    -  *A dialog box is displayed*.  
    ![](../media/007416d672d4724d28176d23b4f32e04.png)
