### Replace

There are three ways of opening the Replace tab

1.  From the Find/Replace dialog – click the **Replace** tab
1.  **Ctrl-H** the keyboard shortcut.
1.  **Menu** \> **Edit** \> **Replace**.
1.  Open the Find and Replace dialog.
1.  Change the text in the **Find** box if needed.
1.  Type the text you want to replace it with in the **Replace with** box.
1.  Click **Replace** button.  
    -  *Instead of showing you a list of matches, Paratext opens the Replace dialog and shows you one match at a time*.

### Replacing matches

-  **Yes** or **No** approve each change individually.
-  **Yes to all** will approve all the remaining proposed changes, so this needs to be **used with care**.  
    - *Make absolutely sure it is a change you want to make everywhere (e.g. review with Find first)*.
-  If you want to stop the process completely, click **Cancel**.  
   - *Please note, any changes you have already clicked Yes for will not be cancelled*.
   - *Paratext will inform you how many matches were not changed because you did not have the permission to edit them*.
:::note
Find and Replace Yes to all only makes changes in places you have permission to edit.
