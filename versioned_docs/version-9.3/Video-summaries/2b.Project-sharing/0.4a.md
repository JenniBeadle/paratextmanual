title: DRF - Send/Receive Explanation (0.4)
---
To facilitate teamwork, Paratext allows you to collaborate using a feature called Send/Receive. Send/Receive also creates a back-up of your project on another device and is valuable even for translators working on their own.

### Send/receive â€“ various methods

-  Send/receive by Internet (ideal)
-  Send/receive by USB
-  Network folder or Chorus Hub.

### Avoiding two people editing at the same

With several people actively working on the same project at the same time, it is necessary to avoid situations where two translators draft the same chapter at the same time!

:::caution
An administrator needs to **add** you to a project, and **assign** books to you.
