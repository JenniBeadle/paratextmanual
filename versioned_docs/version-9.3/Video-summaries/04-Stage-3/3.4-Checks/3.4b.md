The Quotations check examines quotation marks in the text, and verifies that they follow the project’s rules for quotations.

### Quotation rules

Only administrators can change the rules, but you can look at them.

1.  Open the **menu** for the project.
1.  Expand the menu.
1.  Under **Project Settings** click **Quotation Rules**.

See the example at the bottom of the dialog box to see the three levels of quotes.

1.  Quotes
2.  Quotes within quotes, and
3.  Quotes within quotes within quotes.

In addition to opening and closing quotation marks, there is a continuer quotation mark.
