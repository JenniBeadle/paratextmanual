The Repeated words check finds words which have been repeated in succession in the text. These are not necessarily all typing mistakes.

### Repeated Words inventory

1.  Open the **menu** for the project.
1.  **Expand** the menu.
1.  Hover over **Checking Inventories**.
1.  Click **Repeated Words**.  
    -  *All the words which are found repeated in succession are listed here.*
1.  To record words as correct, click **Valid**.
1.  To record words as incorrect, click **Invalid**.

If a repeated word is correct in some contexts but not necessarily always correct, *leave the status as unknown.*

### Run Check from Assignments and Progress dialog 
1.  Click the issue count to view the issues.  
   *Paratext opens a panel or updates a panel to show the issues.*
1.  To view an issue in the Scripture text, double-click the issue.  
    -  *Paratext scrolls the project window to show the repeated word and selects it.*

If the repetition is a mistake, we can delete it.
