title: Interlineariser - How to start (3.3a)
---

There are several different purposes for using the interlinearizer, some of which have an interlinear text as the end result, others which use the interlinearizer as a first step in producing another project. This could be a back translation, an adaptation or a revision.

### To open the Interlinearizer

- Click on the â‰¡ menu for the project.
- Expand the menu.
- Under Tools, click **Interlinearizer**.
    - *The Interlinearizer dialog box opens.*

## Choose what you want to use the interlinear for

### Create Glosses for the project based on a model text.

- Choose which project or resource you want to use as the model text.
- Paratext uses statistics to guess glosses which are drawn directly and exclusively from the model text.

:::tip
For more semantically accurate guessed glosses, select a previously prepared back translation of the project as the model text.

Either way, you need to correct any inappropriate glosses and provide glosses where they are missing.
:::

- You can check to box to output the glosses to a separate project.

### Create Glosses for the project with no model text

- Initially Paratext will not be able to gloss any words.
- Once you have manually glossed a word, Paratext will suggest your gloss when that word recurs.
- To get started, you need to specify which language you will be glossing in.
- You also have the option to save the glosses to a separate project for further editing or to add notes.

### Create a back translation of the project

- For this option, you are required to select a model text.
- Paratext uses statistical analysis to guess which words are equivalent, and aligns them.
- You are also required to select a back translation project to copy the approved glosses into.
- This can be an existing project or, if you are an administrator, you can opt to create a new one.
- If a translation team has used a certain word consistently for a key term, Paratext's statistical analysis will pair up the two words.

### Create adaptation/revision of the project

- This option is similar to creating glosses with no model text.
- You must select a project for the interlinear output to be copied to.
- This can be an existing or a new daughter project.

### Next time you open the Interlinearizer dialog

Paratext gives you a quick way to reopen a previous interlinearization you have worked on.

- The Choose dropdown now has two sections.
  - *At the top are the 4 original options, then below the line, Paratext will display any interlinear options you have previously selected and used.*
- Click one to select it.
  - *The settings you selected last time are displayed.*
- Click **OK** to continue working on this interlinear.

### If you need to change the settings

- Click the padlock icon to unlock the settings.
  - *The settings controls become active.*

### Delete the interlinear setup

- Click the trash can icon to delete the interlinear set-up.
- Click **Delete** to confirm the deletion.

:::note
Previously saved glosses are not deleted by this action, and will be suggested again in future work.
