---
In this video we are going to look at some additional ways that the Biblical Terms Tool can help us achieve a consistent translation.

**Set the verse filter**

1.  Click the verses filter and select “**Choose**”.  
   *The Choose dialog box opens.*
1.  Click the Books tab.
1.  Click New Testament.    
    -  *All the books in the New Testament are now selected.*
1.  Click [**OK**].

**Find a biblical term**

1.  Click in the Find box.
1.  Type the text to find.

**To correct a typo**

1.  Click on the term
1.  Click the **Edit** hyperlink.
1.  Edit the text in this small window.
1.  Click **OK** to save the changes.  
    -  *Paratext now recognises the rendering*.

**Approve a wording even though different**

-  Click on the **red X**.  
    -  *This tells Paratext that the wording is appropriate in this context even though there is not a specific, explicit rendering*.

**Add a note to remind to discuss**

1.  Double click the first column next to the term.  
    -  *A note window opens*
1.  Type the note…
1.  Click [**OK**].

**Add another rendering**

1.  Select the text
1.  Click **Add Rendering**.  
    -  *The new rendering is added to the row in the Biblical Terms table*.

**Change a synonym**

For consistency’s sake we should change it.

1.  Click the **Edit** hyperlink.
1.  Change the word.
1.  Click **OK**.



**Found column**

-  When all occurrences of the biblical term have an identified rendering a tick is shown in the found column.

-  When the symbol in the Found column includes a tiny **X** it is to remind us that one of the renderings is a permitted omission of a rendering.
