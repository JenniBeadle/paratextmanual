Before drafting the back translation, make sure that all the prerequisite tasks have been done and there are no outstanding issues blocking the drafting task. Dealing with these issues first means you have a more stable vernacular translation to be working from. A back translation is stored in a separate but linked project.

### Create a project for the back translation

To create the project,

1.  Open the **main Paratext menu**.
1.  **Expand** the menu.
1.  Click **New Project**…

    -  *Versification and registration are inherited from the linked project*.
1.  Click **OK.**
1.  Select USFM 3 or 2 as appropriate to your needs.

**Create the books you need**
1.  Click **Create Book**.
