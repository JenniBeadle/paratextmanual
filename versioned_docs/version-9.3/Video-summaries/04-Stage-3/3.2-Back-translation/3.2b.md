Before drafting the back translation, make sure that all the prerequisite tasks have been done and there are no outstanding issues blocking the drafting task. Dealing with these issues first means you have a more stable vernacular translation to be working from. A back translation is stored in a separate but linked project.

### Create a project for the back translation

To create the project,

1.  Open the **main Paratext menu**.
1.  **Expand** the menu.
1.  Click **New Project**…  
    -  *The Project Properties dialog opens*.

**To change the project’s name**

1.  Click the **Edit** button.
1.  Click **OK**.

**Fill-in more details** 
1.  In **Language**,
1.  select the major language the translation **consultant** is fluent in.
1.  In **Type of Project**,
1.  select **Back translation**.
1.  In **Based on**,
1.  select the project this is a back translation of.  
    -  *Versification and registration are inherited from the linked project*.
1.  Click **OK.**
1.  Select USFM 3 or 2 as appropriate to your needs.

**Create the books you need**
1.  Click **Create Book**.
1.  The pre-selected option is correct to copy the format markers from the linked project.
1.  Click **OK**.
    -  *The back translation project is created and has all the standard format markers from the base project*.
