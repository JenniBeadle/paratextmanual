In this video we will learn the best way to insert verse numbers.

Many Paratext users type their translation into a book outline, that includes all the chapter and verse numbers they need up front. However, there are still times when you might need to insert a verse number.

### Add a missing verse number (menu)

1.  Place the cursor where you want the verse number to be inserted.
1.  Open the **â‰¡ menu** for the project.
1.  Under **Insert**, choose **verse number**.  
    -  *The verse marker is inserted along with the appropriate verse number*.

### To use the keyboard shortcut

1.  Place the cursor where you want the verse number to be inserted.
1.  Press **Ctrl+K.**  
    -  *The verse marker is inserted along with the appropriate verse number*.



:::tip
If you try to add a verse number between two consecutive verses nothing happens. If you try to add another verse number at the end of the chapter nothing happens. This feature does not allow you to add more verse numbers than there should be in the given chapter.
