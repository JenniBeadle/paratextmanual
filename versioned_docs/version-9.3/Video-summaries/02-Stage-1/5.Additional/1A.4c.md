There are three ways to find out if a term already has an entry in the glossary or not.

### Filter for “Glossary Entries”

-  Change the filter from “All terms” to “Glossary Entries”.
    -  *Paratext will now only list the Biblical terms that do have a glossary entry*.

### An asterisk = it has glossary entry for the current term

-  No asterisk = no glossary entry linked
1.   Click on the Glossary tab.
1.   Click the dropdown arrow at the end of the citation form box.  
      -  *A list of all the citation forms in the Glossary appears*.
1.   Type the citation form to filter the list.
1.   If on the list, select the entry.  
      -  *Paratext fills in the citation form and definition fields automatically using the information from the entry in the glossary*.

#####  
### Glossary (GLO) book

1.   Click the book dropdown arrow and select Glossary (GLO).  
      -  *All of the project’s glossary entries are listed alphabetically*.
1.   Scroll down to where the entry should be, and verify if it is there or not.
