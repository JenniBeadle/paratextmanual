title: Send/Receive Explanation (0.4a)
---
Teamwork is essential for good Bible translation. To facilitate this teamwork, Paratext allows you to collaborate using a feature called Send/Receive. Send/Receive also creates a back-up of your project on another device and is incredibly valuable even for translators working on their own.

### Send/receive – various methods

1.  Send/receive by Internet (ideal)
1.  Send/receive by USB
1.  Network folder or Chorus Hub.

### Avoiding two people editing at the same

With several people actively working on the same project at the same time, some organization is necessary to avoid situations like two translators drafting the same chapter at the same time!

:::caution
An administrator needs to **add** you to a project, and **assign** books to you.
