The guessed rendering is shown in the Renderings box with its orange background.

    -  *The Edit Renderings dialog box opens*.

### Drag and drop – one-time setup

By default, drag and drop is disabled in Paratext to prevent you from reordering words by accident.

    -  *The Paratext Settings dialog box opens*.
1.  “Enable Drag-and-Drop in Text Windows” is **not selected**.

    -  *Drag and drop is now enabled*.

### Using Drag and drop

1.  First, select the relevant word or phrase.
1.  Then click on the selection but keep holding down the **left** mouse button.
1.  Whilst keeping the mouse button down, drag the mouse pointer to the row for the term in the Biblical Terms Renderings panel.
1.  Let go of the mouse button.  
    -  *The word appears in the Renderings column*.

### Using the full Biblical Terms window

The full Biblical Terms window provides another way to identify a rendering and approve a guess.

1.  Open the **menu** for the window.
1.  **Expand** the menu.
1.  Under **Tools**, click **Biblical Terms**.  
    -  *In the Biblical Terms window, the lowest pane displays the verses where the selected Biblical term occurs*.
